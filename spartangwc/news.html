                    <p>
                        Let's face it: we're all tired of Zoom these days.
                        So, we'll be using a new platform for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC:
                        <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>.
                        We think it will make for a great online learning experience!
                        You can find more information in Gather's
                        <a href="https://gather.town/docs">documentation</a>, but we provide a brief summary below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gather is built around the idea of virtual proximity:
                        you can move into and out of conversations in a virtual space by moving an avatar of yourself.
                        When your avatar is near another person's avatar, their video and audio will connect with yours and you'll be able to chat with them.
                        When your avatars move apart, your video and audio will disconnect.
                        This makes it easy for multiple groups of people to hold separate conversations at the same time
                        without the hassle of breakout rooms. In a sense, it recreates in-person interactions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll be giving a full tutorial and demo of Gather at our first meeting, so don't stress about it!
                        We think you'll like it much better than Zoom.
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Attendance</h4>
                    <p>
                        With 18 MSU student-mentors and over 75 participants registered for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC,
                        we're on track for a record-breaking year! Help us keep it that way by striving to attend
                        at least 8 of our 10 meetings between 1/23 and 3/27. The more meetings you attend,
                        the more fun you'll have!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had to close registration in early January and turn a number of participants away in order to
                        keep our participant-to-mentor ratio from growing too large, so remember that your spot is valuable!
                    </p>
                    <h4>6. Participant Handbook</h4>
                    <p>
                        MSU Youth Program Policy requires us to distribute a
                        document detailing proper conduct of MSU student-mentors, faculty, staff and participants.
                        We don't expect to run into any issues this spring, but encourage you to review our
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yAM6ZSTKRrQ3XzymoPvGVNGdXqgTy6BF/view?usp=sharing">2021 SGWC Participant Handbook</a>
                        to make sure you do your part in making our program a success.
                    </p>
                    <h4>7. What to Expect</h4>
                    <p>
                        To keep group sizes manageable, we'll be breaking up into cohorts of approximately 25 participants
                        and 6 MSU student-mentors. We'll then work in groups of 2-4 participants
                        within our cohorts throughout the meeting to facilitate collaboration.
                        Cohort assignments will be given at the start of our first meeting on 1/23.

                    <p>
                        Over the course of SGWC, we'll be working through Khan Academy's
                        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
                            "Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"
                        </a>
                        course, learning the basics of computer science by programming visualizations. That's right:
                        we'll be teaching computers how to draw! This curriculum is different from past years of SGWC,
                        so new and returning participants alike will be starting fresh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meetings typically begin with a 15-minute icebreaker, followed by a 15-minute spotlight
                        in which we showcase a different way computer science is used in the real world each week.
                        We'll then cover a set of slides introducing a new programming concept each week for 15 minutes
                        or so before breaking into small groups and working through coding exercises together for
                        about an hour. In the final 15 minutes, we'll reconvene for a reflection session and post-meeting survey!

                        Founded in 2018, Spartan Girls Who Code is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                        6-12th grade students to the wide world of computer science.
                        Combining lessons in web development using HTML and CSS with guest speakers and social activities,
                        SGWC is more than just another extracurricular &mdash; it's a community.
                        We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!
