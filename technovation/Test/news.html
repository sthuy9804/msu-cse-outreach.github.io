                Your participation has truly made a difference as we approach our final week together. The last two weeks, we 
                learned about loops and worked on our final projects! Before we dive into a full recap of Saturday's meeting, we'd like 
                to share a few announcements.

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Saturday 11/11, we started off our last session with icebreakers that were Thanksgiving themed. 
                We then talked about plagiarism and copyright and how important it is to give credit if referencing 
                other work. We then went over logistics for the project presentations.

            </p>
            <p>
                The rest of the time was given to work on final projects, and mentors went around helping students as needed. 
                We ended like always, with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well, what was 
                challenging, and what students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session.

            </p>
            <p>
                Once again, we'd liek to thank all of our participants for joing us! It was a joy getting to work with all of you
                through this program, and we hope to see you all again in the future. 
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Icebreaker, Lessons, Code Along, Exercises from CodeHS. We started the day off with some fun ice breakers. 
                For in-person we had an exciting rock, paper, scissors tournament. In virtual, we had a scavenger hunt and 
                students for a list of items in their rooms.

            </p>
            <p>
                We then jumped into a review, and students got to test their knowledge with a Kahoot. After that, we did a 
                little additional review on expressions and conditionals. We then got into a bonus lesson, going deeper on the 
                topic on conditionals and learning about nested conditionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we introduced our final project which students were very excited about. After, students had time to 
                brainstorm for their final projects as well as had some independent coding time to practice what they have learned.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ended like always, with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well, what was challenging, and what 
                students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session.
            </p>

            <p>
                We started the day with a spotlight in both clubs. In the in person club mentors showed off some of their cool coding projects. 
                In virtual mentors discussed the different possibilities of what you can do with being in Computer Science and the perks of working in tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that we got right into some new material, expressions and conditionals! We did a sneak peek of expressions last week but got a 
                little more in dept, learning about boolean expressions. We then learned about if, if-else statements, and conditionals, as well as comparison operators and how to use them. We then put it 
                into practice with a code a long. The students started working through exercises on CodeHS.

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                We started the day of with a fun icebreaker. In the virtual club we did show and tell, and students got to show any item they wanted. For in person we played a fun name game
                Then next, we jumped into a review session. And review what we had learned from the past two weeks including, variables, input, and type conversion
                After that, we dived right into some new material and learned about expressions!
            </p>
            <p>
                We then did a code a long, and the students started working through exercise on CodeHS to practice.
                We ended like always, with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well, what was challenging, and what students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
                As usual, students concluded Saturday's meeting with a brief reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead. We hope they're as excited as we are for Week 3!
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Our students wasted no time getting started, jumping fearlessly into introductions and icebreakers! Following a brief overview of Technovation and the plan for each weekly meeting this fall, students in each cohort collaborated to draft their very own club contract, laying out their shared expectations and goals towards which to strive this fall. Check out the contracts below&mdash;we're impressed with what our students came up with!
            </p>
            <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
                <div class="row">

                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <p><i>Club contracts from each cohort of Fall 2023 Technovation. Ask your student what their goals are for the fall, and what they hope to get out of their experience!</i></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Week 1</h4>
            <p>
                After completing the Club contracts, we asked coders in our In-Person Cohort to fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/qJrzuSUEJmfmjW4E8 ">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and coders in our virtual program to fill the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/FS23-PreSurvey">Virtual Fall 2023 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a>. If your student did not submit this survey because they arrived late or just ran out of time, please ask them to do so. 
            </p>

            <h4>Week 2</h4>
            <p>
                To start off the day, in the virtual club we did the icebreaker two truths and a lies
                Then in both in-person and virtual, next we had a spotlight, and mentors showed off some of their personal projects, like a Hologlass!
                After that we got into our lesson on variables and learned how to print variables, find their type, and get user input.

            </p>
            <!--
            <p>
                Students then created CodeHS accounts and began to work through the first few exercises in the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/introtracy/overview">Intro to Python with Tracy</a> course. See the video below for a brief introduction to Tracy and an overview of the programming your students will be learning!

            </div>
            -->
            <p>
                In both sessions students concluded the session with a reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead&mdash;and just like that, our two hours were up! Time flies when we're having fun&mdash;we're already looking forward to next Saturday.

            <h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
            <p>
                The Mentor/Advisor Spotlight! Technovation is led, organized, and run by MSU students under the guidance of advisors from MSU and Ford. The Mentor/Advisor Spotlight introduces a few of our team members each week to help coders get to know them better. Feel free to ask mentors and advisors for more information about their hobbies and past experiences during the Thursday Bonus Hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kick off our spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Fall 2023 Admins!
